# Mobile-Application-Development
<p align="justify">Development of mobile application "ReciCheese" using Android Studio IDE.

The app allows the user to search for recipes in the following ways:
      a) User can select one of the recipes randomly generated and displayed on opening the mobile app.
      b) Can select a specific dish by browsing using the search box provision.
      c) Can browse recipes by category, like breads, pastas, and salads, to name a few.</p>
      
<p align="justify">The application was developed using Android Studio and Java programming language. Spoonacular API was used as a server to obtain the recipes and ingredients of each dish. A key was generated from the Spoonacular API, which is a crucial element in servicing user requests. Libraries like JSON, Retrofit and Picasso were used to parse the response from the Spoonacular Server and appropriately display the recipe contents.

The project was developed as part of the MAD Laboratory curriculum requirements for the 6th semester.</p>
